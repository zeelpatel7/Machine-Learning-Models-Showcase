# Machine-Learning-Models-Showcase

This repository features a diverse collection of machine learning models, including both supervised and unsupervised techniques. Inside you'll find detailed Jupyter notebooks and code examples that demonstrate various approaches to classification, regression, clustering, and more. 

### Binomial, Multinomial Regression

The notebook demonstrates two distinct approaches to classification. For binary (binomial) classification, models such as logistic regression are applied to distinguish between two classes by estimating probabilities and establishing decision boundaries. In contrast, for multiclass (multinomial) classification, the notebook extends these techniques—often via multinomial logistic regression or comparable algorithms—to handle three or more classes, enabling the simultaneous prediction of multiple outcomes. The notebook also details performance evaluation through metrics like accuracy and confusion matrices, providing insights into each model's strengths and limitations as they are applied to real-world data .
